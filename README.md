# Popular-Chess-Openings
Using public data from lichess.org to determine the most popular openings (and specific variations) encountered at the 1000-1100 rating. 

Most of this project is just to rank chess openings by popularity among a give rating range. In my case, I'm about 1050 so this is the rating I chose. My goal for this project was to identify popular openings and their most common variations with the intent of studying them. This way, I can be better prepared for most games I encounter in the future.

The majority of the code is cleaning and reorganizing the data set into a more usable and tidy set so I can achieve what I'm after. I encourage you to customize the rating range at the end to fit your skill level.
